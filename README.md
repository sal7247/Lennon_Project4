Project 4 Proposal

Description:

My plan  for project number 4 is to make something called a “bracket maker”. This project will consist of four pages that let the user create a bracket of ranked participants and run it in real time. The first page will simply be a title page that has a button which links to the first page of the bracket. I’ll have a link to my notes page on this page but other than that the only navigation will be to the second page. On the second page, the user will be able to decide whether or not the bracket is for 8 or 16 participants, and there will be a two radio buttons for this. Below the user will be able to enter each participant's name in a box. There will be a “next” button on the bottom right side of the page which will lead to the third page. On the third page the user will be able to assign a rank to each of the participants. I will have a box full of all the numbers of ranks, and the user will drag and drop the numbers to each participant which will have a box that the number can be placed in. There will be a button similar to the second page to proceed to the 4th page. On the fourth page, the bracket will appear with everyone’s seed assigned next to their name. Each match between two players will have a score button that will prompt the user to enter the score, and the participant with the higher score will proceed forward in the bracket. This will repeat until the final match and after that the winner will be assigned in a box on the bottom right of the page. 

Sketches:



I would like to use this project to replace my other project grades. 

What I will learn:

Since I’m not sure exactly what I’m gonna use to do it yet I can’t exactly fill this in. By class on tuesday I should have this figured out after I talk to you, but since we haven’t talked since class I can’t fill this out.
