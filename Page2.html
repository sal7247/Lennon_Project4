                            ZeRo is a smasher from Chillán, Chile who currently resides in Indiana.
                            He was the undisputed best Smash 4 player in the world throughout 2014 and 2015. With a combination of Diddy Kong and Sheik, he had a record of 56 consecutive tournament wins from the game's release on Wii U in November 2014 until MLG World Finals 2015 in October 2015, including nationals such as Apex 2015, CEO 2015, EVO 2015, Super Smash Con 2015, and The Big House 5. After winning 2GGT: EE Saga, ZeRo went on a 4-month hiatus and made his comeback in the summer of 2016, almost exclusively playing Diddy Kong, mainly due to the Sheik nerfs in 1.1.5. In March 2017, he also picked up Lucina as one of his main characters. While not as dominant as before, he still achieves great tournament results such as 1st at Frostbite 2017, 2GGC: Nairo Saga, CEO 2017, 2GGC: SCR Saga, and Shine 2017, and is still considered the best in the game. ZeRo is currently ranked at the 0 position on the Chicago Smash 4 Power Rankings and 1st on the Panda Global Rankings v3. He was formerly ranked at the 0 position on the SoCal Smash 4 Power Rankings, and was formerly ranked 1st on the New Jersey Smash 4 Power Rankings. He is considered the best Diddy Kong player in the world.

                                MkLeo, also known simply as Leo, is a Smash 4 top professional smasher from Mexico who mains Cloud, Marth, and Meta Knight, with Corrin as a secondary. He is his country's best player and currently considered to be the second best player in the world behind ZeRo. He is also widely considered to be the best Marth player in the world and is considered to be one of the best Cloud players in the world (along with Tweek). He is cousins with professional smashers Serge and Javi.
                                Leo arguably popularized both Meta Knight and Marth, characters that had been seen as mediocre after their nerfs from Brawl, as top players such as Abadango have since used Meta Knight against other top players until his nerfs in game updates, as well as lower-leveled players picking up Marth due to his dominance with him.
                                He is so far the youngest player to win a major Smash 4 tournament, doing so at only 15 years old, achieving this feat at 2GGT: ZeRo Saga. Due to his aggressive style and heavy punish game with Meta Knight and proving his skills surpass those of top players at a very young age, some compare him to Nairo's early Brawl career.
